# Expenses-Tracker-App

This is my MSc Project. The project aimed at developing a reliable, cost-free, user-friendly iOS mobile application to help adults who have difficulty in managing finance. 

* **The built features includes:** secure login, view all userâ€™s spending in one place, track and limit budget, categorise transactions into different category, display spending data in an animated pie chart and forecast spending using linear regression.
* React Native Framework was used for implementing front end where code was written in Xcode.
* Server-side was built using Express Node.js framework and deployed in Heroku.
* API routes were written in Node.js and authenticated using JSON Web Token (JWT). 
* MongoDB was used to store data as it grows with user needs and easy to scale. 
* Jest and Enzyme were used for unit testing whereas Appium was used for UI automation testing.
* Several React Native library were used such as react-native-date picker, react-native-vector-icons, Victory pie, react-native-progress-bar-animated and Node Mailer (email sending).
